# Notes

Notebook key:
* Notebooks **with** `introduction` at the start of their filename are the starting point for learning about each of the modules: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.
* Notebooks **with** `-video.ipynb` on the end are notebooks written during the video lectures of the course.
* Notebooks **without** `-video.ipynb` have much more text and information about the code being written (plenty of extra annotations) and can be used to learn more about what's happening in the videos.
* Notebooks **with** `-OLD.ipynb` have deprecated or broken code in them and should be ignored, they are only kept due to possibly being used to reference later for fixing older errors.
* Exercise notebooks should be attempted before visiting notebooks with `-solutions.ipynb` suffixes.
