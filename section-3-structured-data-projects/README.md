# Section 3 - Structured Data Projects

Structured data is data you'd usually find in an Excel spreadsheet, pandas DataFrame or similar tabular style file.

The notebooks in this folder deal with two end-to-end machine learning modelling projects using the tools from the previous section.

Key:
* Notebooks with "-video" on the end are taken directly from the lectures on Udemy.
* Notebooks without "-video" on the end include annotations and extra information not seen in the lectures.
